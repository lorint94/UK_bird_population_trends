# UK Bird Population Trends

## Identifying patterns with population declines

### Key questions: 
##### Which UK bird species are in decline? Why is this the case? 

### Findings:
##### Turtle doves are a key species in strong decline.
##### Species of specialist habitat types are at a greater risk than those in generalist habitat types.
##### Migratory status appears to be another risk factor with a greater proportion of species in decline among summer migrants compared to resident or winter migrants.
